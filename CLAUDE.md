# Signal — Autonomous Engineering Action Agent
## CLAUDE.md — Read this first before writing any code

---

## What We Are Building

Signal is an autonomous agent that listens to customer signals — emails and recorded
calls — and automatically takes engineering action across the company's toolstack
without any human in the loop.

A customer emails about a bug → Jira ticket created, Slack notified, roadmap updated.
A call recording is uploaded → transcribed, classified, cross-referenced against past
signals, actions taken, CEO digest updated.

Nobody manually triages. Nobody decides what to build. The agent does.

**Hackathon:** Multimodal Frontier Hackathon (Mar 28, 2026)
**Submission deadline:** 4:30 PM PT
**Demo:** 5:00 PM PT — 3 minutes
**Team:** 2 people

## The Core Pipeline

```
TRIGGER
  Email received (webhook) OR call recording uploaded (POST /upload)
        │
        ▼
STAGE 1 — TRANSCRIBE + UNDERSTAND
  - If audio: transcribe with Whisper API
  - If email: parse raw text
  - Extract: customer name, company, sentiment, key phrases
  - Classify: BUG | FEATURE_REQUEST | CHURN_RISK | PRAISE | QUESTION
  - Assign urgency score 1-10
        │
        ▼
STAGE 2 — MEMORY LOOKUP (Senso)
  - Search Senso KB for similar past signals
  - Count: how many other customers said something similar?
  - Retrieve: what actions were taken last time?
  - Calculate: frequency score
        │
        ▼
STAGE 3 — ROUTING DECISION
  - BUG + urgency >= 7 OR frequency >= 3: create Jira P1, ping Slack #engineering
  - BUG + urgency < 7: create Jira P2, no Slack
  - FEATURE_REQUEST + frequency >= 5: update Notion roadmap, Slack #product
  - FEATURE_REQUEST + frequency < 5: log to Senso only
  - CHURN_RISK: Slack #cs-team immediately, draft reply email, flag for CEO digest
  - PRAISE: log to Senso, add to CEO digest only
        │
        ▼
STAGE 4 — EXECUTE ACTIONS
  - Jira: create ticket with full context and customer quotes
  - Notion: update roadmap page priority or add new item
  - Slack: send formatted message to correct channel
  - Email: draft reply to customer
  - Senso: store this signal + actions taken for future memory
        │
        ▼
STAGE 5 — LOG + STREAM
  - Write action log entry to database
  - Stream event via SSE to frontend activity feed
  - Append to CEO digest
```

## Sponsor Tools — Exact Usage

### Railtracks — Agent Orchestration
Every stage is a Railtracks agent node. Do not use raw LLM calls for orchestration.
Railtracks IS the pipeline.

```python
import railtracks as rt

@rt.function_node
async def transcribe_and_classify(input: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Input: { "type": "audio"|"email", "content": bytes|str }
    Output: {
        "text": str,
        "classification": "BUG"|"FEATURE_REQUEST"|"CHURN_RISK"|"PRAISE"|"QUESTION",
        "urgency": int,  # 1-10
        "customer": str,
        "company": str,
        "key_phrases": list[str],
        "sentiment": "positive"|"negative"|"neutral"
    }
    """
    ...

@rt.function_node
async def search_memory(classification_result: dict) -> dict:
    """Search Senso for similar past signals. Returns frequency + related actions."""
    ...

@rt.function_node
async def decide_actions(memory_result: dict) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Returns list of actions.
    Each: { "type": "jira"|"notion"|"slack"|"email", "payload": {} }
    """
    ...

@rt.function_node
async def execute_actions(actions: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Execute each action against real APIs. Return results with URLs."""
    ...

@rt.function_node
async def update_digest(signal: dict, actions: list[dict]) -> None:
    """Append signal + actions to CEO digest in Senso."""
    ...

signal_pipeline = rt.agent_node(
    "Signal Processor",
    tool_nodes=(
        transcribe_and_classify,
        search_memory,
        decide_actions,
        execute_actions,
        update_digest
    ),
    llm=rt.llm.OpenAILLM("gpt-4o"),
    system_message="""You are an autonomous engineering operations agent.
    Process customer signals (emails and call recordings) and take
    appropriate engineering actions without human intervention.

    Classification rules:
    - BUG: customer reports something broken or not working as expected
    - FEATURE_REQUEST: customer asks for something new or different
    - CHURN_RISK: customer expresses frustration or mentions cancelling
    - PRAISE: customer expresses satisfaction
    - QUESTION: customer needs information or clarification

    Always err toward taking action rather than waiting.
    Multiple customers reporting the same thing means higher priority.
    Churn risk always gets immediate Slack notification.
    Never hallucinate customer names, company names, or technical details.
    Only use information from the actual signal content."""
)
```

### Senso.ai — Memory and Knowledge Layer
Install skills first:
```bash
npx @senso-ai/shipables install senso-ai/senso-ingest
npx @senso-ai/shipables install senso-ai/senso-search
```

Three types of content stored in Senso:

**1. Customer signals**
```python
# backend/agents/memory.py
import requests, os

SENSO_API = "https://api.senso.ai"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['SENSO_API_KEY']}"}

async def ingest_signal(signal: dict) -> str:
    content = f"""
Customer: {signal['customer']} at {signal['company']}
Type: {signal['classification']}
Urgency: {signal['urgency']}/10
Summary: {signal['text'][:500]}
Key phrases: {', '.join(signal['key_phrases'])}
Actions taken: {signal.get('actions_summary', 'none')}
    """
    r = requests.post(f"{SENSO_API}/content", headers=HEADERS, json={
        "text": content,
        "metadata": {
            "type": "customer_signal",
            "classification": signal['classification'],
            "company": signal['company'],
            "urgency": signal['urgency']
        }
    })
    return r.json()["id"]

async def search_similar_signals(key_phrases: list[str], classification: str) -> dict:
    query = f"{classification}: {' '.join(key_phrases[:3])}"
    r = requests.get(f"{SENSO_API}/search", headers=HEADERS,
        params={"query": query, "limit": 10})
    results = r.json()["results"]
    return {
        "frequency": len(results),
        "related_signals": results
    }
```

**2. CEO digest** — appended to throughout the day, retrieved on GET /digest

**3. Roadmap state** — synced when Notion updates happen

### Jira Integration
```python
# backend/integrations/jira.py
import requests
from base64 import b64encode
import os

def create_ticket(summary: str, description: str, priority: str,
                  issue_type: str, customer_quote: str) -> dict:
    auth = b64encode(
        f"{os.environ['JIRA_EMAIL']}:{os.environ['JIRA_API_TOKEN']}".encode()
    ).decode()
    r = requests.post(
        f"{os.environ['JIRA_BASE_URL']}/rest/api/3/issue",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Basic {auth}", "Content-Type": "application/json"},

                "type": "paragraph",
                "content": [{"type": "text",
                    "text": f'Customer said: "{customer_quote}"\n\n{description}'}]
            }]},
            "issuetype": {"name": issue_type},
            "priority": {"name": priority},
            "labels": ["signal-agent"]
        }}
    )
    result = r.json()
    return {
        "ticket_key": result["key"],
        "url": f"{os.environ['JIRA_BASE_URL']}/browse/{result['key']}"
    }
```

### Slack Integration
```python
# backend/integrations/slack.py
import requests, os

def send_alert(channel_env_key: str, signal: dict, actions: list) -> None:
    requests.post(os.environ['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'], json={
        "text": f"Signal Agent: *{signal['classification']}* detected",
        "blocks": [
            {"type": "section", "text": {"type": "mrkdwn", "text":
                f"*{signal['classification']}* from {signal['customer']} "
                f"at {signal['company']}\n"
                f"Urgency: {signal['urgency']}/10\n"
                f"_{signal['text'][:200]}..._"
            }},
            {"type": "section", "text": {"type": "mrkdwn", "text":
                "*Actions taken automatically:*\n" +
                "\n".join([f"• {a}" for a in actions])
            }}
        ]
    })
```

### Notion Integration
```python
# backend/integrations/notion.py
from notion_client import Client
import os

notion = Client(auth=os.environ["NOTION_API_KEY"])

def create_roadmap_item(title: str, description: str,
                        priority: str, signal_count: int) -> str:
    page = notion.pages.create(
        parent={"database_id": os.environ["NOTION_ROADMAP_DB_ID"]},
        properties={
            "Name": {"title": [{"text": {"content": title}}]},
            "Priority": {"select": {"name": priority}},
            "Status": {"select": {"name": "Considering"}},
            "Signal Count": {"number": signal_count},
            "Source": {"select": {"name": "Signal Agent"}}
        }
    )
    return page["url"]
```

### assistant-ui — Dashboard
```bash
npx assistant-ui create frontend
cd frontend && npm install
```

Two panel layout:
- **Left:** Chat — CEO asks natural language questions about customer signals,
  answered from Senso knowledge base
- **Right:** Live activity feed — SSE stream showing each agent action as it fires

```typescript
// frontend/app/api/stream/route.ts
// SSE endpoint streaming activity log to frontend in real time
export async function GET() {
  const stream = new ReadableStream({ ... })
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/event-stream" }
  })
}
```

### Unkey — API Auth (do this last, 20 minutes)
```python
# backend/auth/unkey.py
from unkey import Unkey
from fastapi import Header, HTTPException
import os

unkey_client = Unkey(root_key=os.environ["UNKEY_ROOT_KEY"])

async def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):
    result = await unkey_client.keys.verify({"key": x_api_key})
    if not result.valid:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API key")
    return result
```

### DigitalOcean — Deployment
Use App Platform, not raw droplets.
1. Push code to GitHub
2. App Platform → New App → connect repo
3. Set all env vars in the dashboard
4. Deploy (3-4 minutes)
5. Get live public URL

## Signal Classification + Routing Rules

| Classification | Triggers | Jira | Notion | Slack | Digest |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG (urgency >= 7) | broken, crash, error | P1 Bug | — | #engineering | yes |
| BUG (urgency < 7) | not working, fails | P2 Bug | — | — | yes |
| FEATURE_REQUEST (freq >= 5) | wish, need, add | Story | update priority | #product | yes |
| FEATURE_REQUEST (freq < 5) | would love, missing | — | — | — | yes |
| CHURN_RISK | cancel, leaving, switching | — | — | #cs-team immediately | yes |
| PRAISE | love, amazing, great | — | — | — | yes |
| QUESTION | how do I, can I | — | — | — | no |

Frequency multiplier: 3-4 customers = urgency +2, 5+ customers = urgency +4

## Build Order

### Hour 1: 11:00am — 12:00pm

**Person 1:**
- `pip install railtracks openai requests notion-client`
- Build `transcriber.py` — Whisper API with test audio file
- Build `classifier.py` — returns classification dict from transcript
- Wire into Railtracks pipeline in `pipeline.py`
- Test with hardcoded fake transcript
- **Goal:** pipeline classifies a fake transcript correctly

**Person 2:**
- `npx assistant-ui create frontend`
- Get two-panel layout running at localhost:3000
- Build `slack.py` — send one real test message to Slack
- **Goal:** Slack message appears in real channel (proves real action early)

### Hour 2: 12:00pm — 1:00pm

**Person 1:**
- Build `memory.py` — ingest to Senso, search back
- Build `jira.py` — create one real Jira ticket from test data
- Build `notion.py` — create one real Notion page from test data
- Wire: transcribe → classify → Senso → Jira
- **Goal:** fake transcript creates real Jira ticket end to end

**Person 2:**
- Build `main.py` with `/upload` and `/alerts/stream` routes
- Build SSE that streams test events every 5 seconds
- Connect `ActivityFeed.tsx` to SSE stream
- **Goal:** frontend shows live events from backend

### Hour 3: 1:30pm — 2:30pm

**Person 1:**
- Build `router.py` with full routing table above
- Connect full pipeline: transcribe → classify → Senso → route → Jira + Notion + Slack
- Test with 3 different signal types
- **Goal:** one audio file in → Jira + Slack + Senso out

**Person 2:**
- Wire `/upload` to Person 1's pipeline
- Build `UploadZone.tsx` — drag and drop audio
- Connect chat to Senso search
- Build `DigestPanel.tsx`
- **Goal:** full end to end visible in UI

### Hour 4: 2:30pm — 3:30pm

**Person 1:**
- Build `digest.py` — generate CEO summary from Senso
- Add Unkey auth to all routes
- **Goal:** /digest returns real formatted summary

**Person 2:**
- Push to GitHub, deploy on DigitalOcean App Platform
- Test live URL
- Fix worst visual bug
- **Goal:** live public URL, everything works

### Hour 5: 3:30pm — 4:30pm — DEMO PREP ONLY
- Stop adding features
- Run demo 3 times out loud, timed
- Prepare cached backup results
- Write Devpost submission
- Publish to Shipables

## The 3-Minute Demo Script

**Before going on stage:**
1. Have a 30-second fake customer call recording ready
2. Jira project open in browser tab
3. Slack channel open in another tab
4. Signal dashboard open in third tab
5. CEO digest pre-generated

**0:00 — 0:20: Hook**
"Every week PMs spend hours listening to calls, reading emails, deciding what to build.
Engineers wait. Roadmaps go stale. We built Signal — an agent that turns customer
signals into engineering action automatically."

**0:20 — 1:00: Trigger**
"I'm uploading a real customer call right now."
→ Drag audio into upload zone
→ Show activity feed firing: transcribing... classifying... searching history...
→ "It found 4 other customers reported the same thing this month."

**1:00 — 2:00: The actions**
→ Switch to Jira — real ticket just appeared, created by the agent
→ Switch to Slack — real message in #engineering
→ Switch back — Notion roadmap item promoted to P1
"Three real engineering actions. Zero human input. 45 seconds."

**2:00 — 2:30: The intelligence**
→ Show CEO digest
"The CEO got this this morning. 12 customers mentioned export bugs.
3 are churn risks. Top requested feature has 8 signals.
No meeting required. The agent tracked all of it."

**2:30 — 3:00: Business case**
"You could hire a full-time ops person for $80,000 a year to do this manually.
Signal costs $299 a month. Every company with customers and an engineering
team needs this. That is every company."

---

## Backup Plans

**If audio transcription is slow:** Pre-transcribe the demo audio. POST the text
directly to `/monitor` skipping transcription. Pipeline still runs fully.

**If Jira fails:** Lead with Slack message. Equally real. Explain Jira is one
of multiple action targets.

**If DigitalOcean fails:** Demo from localhost with ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

**If everything breaks:** Show the pre-generated CEO digest. Walk through what
the agent found and what actions it took. The intelligence is compelling on its own.
